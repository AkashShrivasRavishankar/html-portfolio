 <body><h1>Top 3 animes according to me as of now</h1>
 <h2>Here are some of my favourite animes currently</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
 <p>A show which appears to be a kids show turns dark and thrilling which impressed me.</p>
  <h3>Grand Blue Dreaming</h3>
 <p>This one is for the boys. A show that inspires you to live your life with glee.</p>
  <h3>Tokyo Revengers</h3>
 <p>Before starting the show, I felt gang stuff is very boring. This show explored romance, time travel and bromance all at once which impressed me.</p></body><h1>
